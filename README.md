## Database: DB Browser for SQLite; System.Data.SQLite
## Why use SQLite?
  SQLite is Serverless: SQLite does not require a separate server process to operate. It's self-contained and doesn't have any external dependencies, making it perfect for standalone applications.
  
  SQLite is Cross-Platform: SQLite databases can be easily deployed across various platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS. This means the application can run on devices with different operating systems without any compatibility issues.
  
  SQLite is Lightweight: SQLite is lightweight and has a small footprint, making it suitable for embedding in applications. SQLite database file can be included directly with the application, simplifying deployment and avoiding the need for users to install additional software.
  
  SQLite Supports SQL Queries: SQLite supports a subset of SQL queries, allowing operations like adding, updating, and querying kdrama episode data easily. It's powerful enough to handle more than 50 kdramas without any performance issues.
